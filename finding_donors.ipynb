    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf).

One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature.

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: ** [AdaBoost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost) is a type of \"Ensemble Learning\" where multiple learners are employed to build a stronger learning algorithm. It is a popular boosting technique which helps to combine multiple “weak classifiers” into a single “strong classifier”. A weak classifier is simply a classifier that performs poorly, but performs better than random guessing. We usually use AdaBoost in conjunction with other learning algorithms to improve their performance. Hence the word ‘boosting’, as in it boosts other algorithms! Boosting is a general method for improving the accuracy of any given learning algorithm. So obviously, adaptive boosting refers to a boosting algorithm that can adjust itself to changing scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost assigns a “weight” to each training example, which determines the probability that each example should appear in the training set. Examples with higher weights are more likely to be included in the training set, and vice versa. After training a classifier, AdaBoost increases the weight on the misclassified examples so that these examples will make up a larger part of the next classifiers training set, and hopefully the next classifier trained will perform better on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If each sample consists of a huge number of potential features, the overall system becomes very slow. This is the reason we cannot use a powerful model with a full feature set because it cannot run in real time. We can only afford to have simple machine learning algorithms. But if the algorithms are too simple, they tend to be less accurate. They are called ‘weak learners’. So we cascade them together to create a strong classifier. The output of ‘weak learners’ is combined into a weighted sum that represents the final output of the boosted classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost is adaptive in the sense that subsequent weak learners are tweaked in favor of those instances misclassified by previous classifiers. When we collect the set of weak learners, we give equal weights to all of them. But on each round, the weights of incorrectly classified examples are increased so that the weak learner is forced to focus on the hard examples in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an example:\n",
    "Let’s say we are given the task of listing out all the people in the city of San Francisco who are taller than 5’7″, weigh less than 190 lbs, and are between the ages of 28 and 41. Now the problem is that we are supposed to do this without the help of machines. So the only thing we are allowed to do is take a look at the person and determine whether or not that person qualifies. How do we do it? We may or may not be good at estimating these parameters just by looking at the person. So to improve the accuracy, consider three people which will help us in estimating this. The first person is really good at guessing the height, the second person is really good at guessing the weight and the third person is really good at guessing the age. Individually, they may not be all that useful to us, because they can do only one simple task. But if we combine them together and filter out all the people, we have a very good chance of getting an accurate list of people who qualify.This is the concept behind AdaBoost.\n",

When the model was trained for full data, both the scores were relatively higher. Therefore, on reducing the number of features, our model's accuracy and F-score were also reduced. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If training time was a factor, I would still consider the reduced data because AdaBoost is faster as compared to other algorithms and gives accurate results. Training on large sets gives more accurate results than the reduced set but if it is taking more time to process then it is not good. There might be better algorithms that can give good scores for reduced dataset. If we consider the above case, the accuracy and F-score are not affected much as compared to full data. The overall decrease is approximately 0.2 and 0.4 for accuracy and F-score, which can be compromised if training time is taken as a factor. "
